What Is My Purpose?

A. To find out the best employee amoung the three in thier respective performances.

How Did I Do This?

A. In any hypothesis testing the process flows in a true or false manner. we all know that one way anova test is performed when we have 3 or more discrete inputs and if we want to find a output which is continous.  So, at first I tried to convert each respective column into an individual array and verified if the data followed normal distribtuion. if it followed then i had perfomred a shapiro test to check the p-value > or < 0.05. If it is > 0.05 it follows the normal distribution. Now we check the means of the indivudal employee through the stats.f_oneway funciton to find out which has the highest value to make a decision
